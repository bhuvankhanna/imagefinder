The recent tremendous growth in computer technology has brought a substantial increase in the storage of digital imagery. Storage of such image data is relatively straightforward, but accessing and searching image databases is intrinsically harder than their textual counterparts. The goal of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems is to operate on collections of images and, in response to visual queries, extract relevant images. The application potential of CBIR for fast and effective image retrieval is enormous. The various possible application fields may include web searching, medical diagnosis, geographic information systems, cultural heritage, the military, architectural design, intellectual property, journalism, advertising and so forth.


Based on the theory Content-based image retrieval, our project aims at eliminating the existing limitations of the presently available image retrieval systems. Without the ability to examine image content, searches must rely on metadata such as captions or keywords, which may be laborious or expensive to produce. Therefore, there is a need for developing a new approach that increases the credibility, relevance and neutrality of image search systems.
